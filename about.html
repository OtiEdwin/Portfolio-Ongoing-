            <h2>2016 &mdash; I learn to code <strong>C</strong></h2>
            <h1>Trying new things</h1>
            <p>Being a nigerian developer, Whenever I tell people I spent most of my early days as a dev coding <strong>C/C++</strong>, I'm often looked at with admiration like I had achieved some great feat. Well, as a matter of fact, I spent most of the year 2016 coding <strong>C/C++</strong>. I never worked on any concrete project as I was heavily in lack of resources and support. The most I could do was merely for fun. <br> I came across the <strong>Peter Eastman</strong> C coding challenge entry in 2013 which up until this day amazes me. Anyway, It inspired me to write my somewhat most notable <strong>C</strong> programe which is in the code box below.</p>
            <pre>

      flag = <span class="number">1</span>;            
   }

   <span class="keyword">for</span> ( i = <span class="number">2</span> ; i <=  n / <span class="number">2</span> ; ++i) {       
     <span class="comment">// if n is divisible by i, then n is not prime</span> 
     <span class="comment">// change flag to 1 for non-prime number</span> 
     <span class="keyword">if</span> (n % i == <span class="number">0</span> ) {
         flag = <span class="number">1</span> ;
        <span class="keyword">break</span> ;
      }
   }
   
   <span class="comment">// flag is 0 for prime numbers</span>

            <h1>The tech/smart-contract pandemic</h1>
            <p>In 2020, The year of the dreaded Covid-19 pandemic, There were two other pandemics, One of which i called the <strong>tech pandemic</strong> and the other which I called the <strong>smart-contract pandemic</strong>. At this point in my life, it seemed as though every single person in nigeria had somehow become either a tech person or a crypto person one way or the other. This drove me back to my destiny as a developer ( <i>Reread but this time imagine trimphant music in the background</i> ). <br> My brother and I built a fully functional pyramid scheme android application using android XML and java. We called it ReferMe. Unfortunately for us, the era of pyramid schemes was coming to a fatal end as most of the big names in the business came crashing down. </p>
